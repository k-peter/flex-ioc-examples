# Introduction #

The base project is IOCSample. This project contains examples where ioc frameworks can be useful.

All the other projects are derivations of the base project. They follow the naming convention of:
IOCSample_%nameOfFramework% for example: IOCSample\_flicc._

As new problems are entered into the base project, the plan is to then show how each framework would address it.


# Packaging #
The packaging structure is designed to divide each issue into its own package. I've given the issue a meaningful name (ie: passtheparcel). As more issues are added these should be completely self contained within their own package.
